Contributing
============

Contributions are **welcome**, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Guidelines

- **Follow Standards** - Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md).

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

- **Rebase** - You may also need to [rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.

**Happy coding**!
